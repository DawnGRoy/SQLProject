# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

### Project/Goals
The goal for this project was to analyze the data within the dataset and find any specific unique patterns. 
Leading to a more specific goal of analyzing the checkout process within the dataset to determine some insights into user behaviour, 
identify any potential bottlenecks, and analyze the correlation between completed orders and recorded revenue. The goal of this is to analyze and understand the 
checkout journey from the users perspective so we can optimize the user experience and hopefully generate more revenue. 

### Process
## (Data Retrieval)
	- Use SQL queries to extract relevant data related to the checkout process from the dataset.
## (Data Cleaning)
	- Create a new table to manipulate data better without changing the origin dataset.
	- Clean dataset to remove irrelevant information. 
## (Data Analysis)
	- Conduct an analysis of the dataset to understand progressions of visitors through the checkout process.
	- Examine compelting rates for each checkout step and observe correlation between completed steps and recorded revenue.

### Results
While analyzing the data from the checkout process in the dataset I made the following observations. 
1. A limited number of visitors progressed beyond the initial step. 
2. An even more limited number of visitors completed all three steps within the checkout process. 
3. Most notable, visitors who, within the dataset, only completed the first step of the checkout 
process still had transaction revenues recorded. This suggest a potential dispary between completed 
steps and recorded revenue.

### Challenges 
One of the biggest challenges faced during this analysis included incomplete or missing data within the dataset, 
which could then lead to biased and innacurate findings.  Another challenge includes user drop-offs at varying stages 
of the process could impact ones understanding of the checkout process. 

### Future Goals
Future goals to help better understand the given problem include addressing the incomplete data issues, 
investivating user behaviour patterns to understand the reasons for drop-offs and hopefully optimiza the checkout process to be more user friendly. 
As well as considering additional variables that could be impacting the recorded revenue.
